## Todo list: project for learning frontend

Here you\`re going to improve your frontend skills. 
We are going to begin from a very simple and useless todo application, and we are going to build a complex thing.

### Motivation

Almost all the courses online don\`t give you a "real world" experience.
You write some apps from scratch or even just repeat the code from youtube video - it\`s not a good experience.
Here we are going to fix that. 
You will get some code, and you have to deal with it. 
You will receive some instructions just a description of features/tasks you need to do and that\`s it.

**An important thing here**: you must learn to do what is required of you. 
The lessons here have a good description, so basically it will be clear what you need to do,
and one of your main goal here is doing only what the description asks. 
You must complete each task as precise and fast as you can. 

So, the main rule here would be: **do your tasks, don\`t try to fix the code/types around you, just 
implement your features and don\`t make the code worse**, this is it.

### What do you need to know before starting

- TS - beginner level
- React - medium level

This app is based on Next.js, but you don\`t need to know it, don\`t worry.

### Get started

- make a fork from this repo
- download the repo
- run `nvm install` command(install `nvm` in case you don`t have it)
- run `yarn` command(install `yarn` in case you don`t have it)

### Working process

For developing and solving challenges run `yarn dev` command,
it starts a local server with the app on port 3000 for you.

### How it works

The repo has `learning` dir, each dir inside indicates one lesson and inside lesson`s dir we have:
- `task.md` - a file with the description of your task
- `hints.md` - some valuable hints for you, you can use them during the lesson, or you can check them after you have solved the task before submitting your result. 
- also, it contains a link to pull request with my solution.
- pay attention that each lesson has an order number, and I strongly recommend doing it only in the right order. Especially considering that each lesson starts when the previous lesson ends.

So, the common way to learning:
- choose your lesson
- create a local branch in your repo(your fork of this repo)
- open `task.md` file and read you task
- completely understand what task require you to do
- write your code, do your best and create pull request to your `master` branch
- use `hints.md` file whatever you want, especially if you feel any difficulty
- go to a pull request from `hints.md` file, to compare your solution with mine
- my solution is just a reference, and it could help you with some problems you might have, but don\`t worry if our solutions are not identical
- the next lessons rely on my version of solution, so if you have a completely different code it could be better to make it as close as possible to mine.
- finally, merge you branch into the master branch of your repo
- you are ready for the next lesson

### What if "I don`t get your solution"

If you don\`t understand a solution, or you have any questions, you always can create a github issue,
and I will answer your question.
